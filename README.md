Wanna get a social media avatar? Avatars.io makes it easy for you. Just give a username then get an avatar!

## Getting started

### Twitter :bird:

Give a username and get an avatar in return: `https://avatars.charlyx.dev/twitter?username=charlyx`

You can ask for variant sizings such as "bigger", "mini" and "original" (default size being "normal").

Example: `https://avatars.charlyx.dev/twitter?username=charlyx&size=bigger`

### Gravatar :bust_in_silhouette:

Give an email and get an avatar in return: `https://avatars.charlyx.dev/gravatar?email=mon@email`

By default, images are presented at 80px by 80px if no size parameter is supplied.
You may request a specific image size from 1px up to 2048px by using the s= or size= parameter and passing a single pixel dimension (since the images are square).

Example: `https://avatars.charlyx.dev/gravatar?email=mon@email&s=200`
